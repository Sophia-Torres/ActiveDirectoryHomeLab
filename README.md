<h2>LAB OVERVIEW</h2>

The purpose of this lab is to create a basic Windows networking environment with Active Directory, utilizing Oracle VirtualBox with a Mac OS as a host. This lab will cover the setup of a virtualized domain controller, a client machine, and the configuration of essential networking services (ex. NAT, DNS, DHCP, and Active Directory).

<h2>SOFTWARE</h2>

- ORACLE VIRTUALBOX
- ORACLE VIRTUALBOX ESSENTIALS
- WINDOWS SERVER 2019 ISO
- WINDOWS 10 ISO

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

1. Install and configure Oracle VirtualBox on MacOS to host virtual machines.
2. Set up Windows Server 2019 virtual machine as a domain controller.
3. Set up Windows 10 virtual machine as a client connected to the domain.
4. Configure internal networking, NAT, DHCP, DNS, and Active Directory
5. Use a PowerShell script to automate the creation of 1,000 users in Active Directory
6. Verify that the client machine is connected to the internet and configured properly by using "ipconfig" and "ping" in the Commandline
7. Verify that the client is connected to the domain and able to be logged in using one of the users created with the Powershell script
